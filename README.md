# jadeR for Python
## Blind source separation of real signals

jadeR implements JADE, an Independent Component Analysis (ICA) algorithm
developed by Jean-Francois Cardoso. More information about JADE can be
found among others in: Cardoso, J. (1999) High-order contrasts for
independent component analysis. Neural Computation, 11(1): 157-192.

More information about ICA can be found among others in Hyvarinen A.,
Karhunen J., Oja E. (2001). Independent Component Analysis, Wiley. Or at the

The Python code here was translated into NumPy from the original Matlab Version
1.8 of May 2005 by Gabriel Beckers, http://gbeckers.nl . After that, two 
corrections were made by David Rivest-Hénault to make the code become 
equivalent at machine precision to that of jadeR.m, after which I put the code 
on Github.
